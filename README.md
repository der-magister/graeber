A small gameboy game like digger

Develop for the ZFX Action XVI (https://zfx.info/viewtopic.php?f=49&t=4485) in 2018.

The player controls a dwarf who suspects a precious gem in a small mine. Unfortunately, the mine is at risk of collapse, 
so there is little time to find the stone. In addition, some small dangers lurk in the mine and the pimple takes advantage.
